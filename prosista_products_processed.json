      "full_description_en": "Acoustic glass wool ceiling panels provide solutions for sound control in indoor environments. When used in spaces such as cinemas, conference halls, offices, and hospitals, they contribute to the absorption of sound reflected from ceiling surfaces. This results in improved acoustic performance and a quieter environment. Features of Acoustic Glass Wool Ceiling Panels: Acoustic ceiling panels are created by reinforcing the four edges of glass wool panels with a density of 50–95 kg/m³ and thicknesses of 15 mm–20 mm, and covering the front surface with glass mesh. Acoustic panels are high-performance Class A sound-absorbing panels. Easy to apply. Absorbs sound in the environment, ensuring optimal sound transmission. Carrier systems such as T24, T15, channeled, or concealed systems can be used. Custom production in desired colors can be made for specific projects.",
